**Title:** PDF-to-Text Conversion using LLaMA and Python

**Description:**
This Python script, `pdf_to_text_llama.py`, uses the LLaMA library to convert PDF files into text. The script is designed to be easy to use and provides a simple command-line interface for converting PDFs.

**Features:**

* Supports conversion of PDF files to plain text
* Uses LLaMA's OCR (Optical Character Recognition) capabilities to recognize text in scanned or image-based PDFs
* Can convert multiple PDFs at once, making it easy to process large batches of files
* Provides a simple command-line interface for easy usage

**How to Use:**

1. Install the required libraries (LLaMA and Pillow) using pip: `pip install llama pillow`
2. Run the script using Python: `python pdf_to_text_llama.py`
3. Provide the path to the PDF file(s) you want to convert as a command-line argument:
        * Single file: `python pdf_to_text_lllama.py /path/to/file.pdf`
        * Multiple files: `python pdf_to_text_llama.py /path/to/file1.pdf /path/to/file2.pdf ...`
4. The script will output the converted text to the console, or save it to a file if you specify an output filename

**Options:**

* `-o` or `--output`: Specify the output filename (e.g., `python pdf_to_text_llama.py -o output.txt /path/to/file.pdf`)
* `-v` or `--verbose`: Enable verbose mode, which prints more detailed information about the conversion process (e.g., `python pdf_to_text_llama.py -v /path/to/file.pdf`)

**Limitations:**

* The script may not be able to recognize text in PDFs with complex layouts or fonts
* Performance can vary depending on the size and complexity of the input files
* The script is designed for general-purpose conversion, so it may not work well with certain types of PDFs (e.g., those containing images or tables)
