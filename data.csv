What is the time complexity of the fastest known algorithm for the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem in the 1960s?,θ(2^n)
What is the time complexity of the algorithm developed by Smith and Waterman for the LCS problem in 1981?,θ(n^2)
What is the main distinction between P and NP problems?,"P can be solved deterministically in polynomial time, NP cannot"
What is the definition of NP-completeness?,A decision problem that is in NP and every problem in NP is polynomially reducible to it
What algorithmic approach did Smith and Waterman use to solve the LCS problem?,Dynamic programming
Which problem is described as determining whether two graphs can be drawn identically?,Graph isomorphism
"In the context of algorithm efficiency, what does θ(n log n) represent?",Polynomial time complexity for sorting algorithms like mergesort
What type of problems can be transformed into decision problems to apply NP-completeness theory?,Optimization problems
What are the characteristics of a nondeterministic algorithm?,Exhibits different behaviors on different runs for the same input
What is the relationship between the travelling salesman problem and NP-completeness?,It is a well-known NP-complete problem that seeks a route of the same length through all nodes in a network
