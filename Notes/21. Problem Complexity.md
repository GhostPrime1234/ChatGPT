+ Logarithmic
	+ (all bases have the same growth rate)
	+ $\theta(\log(\log n))$,
	+ $\theta(\log n)$

## The Great Divide
+ All polynomial algorithms include:
	+ Linear
	+ Poly-log
	+ Log
	+ Constant
	+ Sub-linear
+ All exponential algorithms, include:
	+ Factorial
	+ Exponential.
## Problems vs. Algorithm
+ A problem can have many algorithms with different efficiencies, e.g., sorting integers.
	+ Mergesort $\theta(n\log n)$
	+ Permutation sort $\theta(n!)$
+ A specific algorithm's efficiency can vary depending on the input, e.g., Quicksort
	+ $\theta(n\log n)$ - on most unsorted list
	+ $\theta(n^{2})$ - one pre-sorted or partially sorted list.
+ So what can we say about sorting problem?
	+ The sorting problem can be Solved in $\theta(n\log n)$
	+ Solved in $\theta(n!)$
+ We say that the sorting problem is polynomial
	+ Because there exists at least one polynomial algorithm for solving the problem.
+ Some problems have solution algorithms that are intrinsically polynomial
+ But, some problems can NOT be solved in polynomial time
	+ At least most people think so...
	+ But it's hard to prove that something can't be done.
## Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Problem
+ Finding the longest common subsequence to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two sequences).
+ It differs from the longest common substring problem:
	+ Unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences.
--- start-multi-column
+ E.g., $X+ABCBDAB;Y=BDCABA$
	+ The length of LCS is 4.
	+ LCS are $BDAB,BCAB,BCBA$

### LCS: 1960's
+ The LCS problem
	+ Fastest known algorithm can only solve the problem in $\theta(2^{n})$
+ Does there exist an optimal LCS algorithm that has polynomial time?
	+ In 1960, most computer scientists were leaning towards an answer of "*no*", i.e., there does NOT exist a polynomial algorithm.
### LCS: 1980's
+ In 1981, Smith and Waterman used dynamic programming to solve LCS problem in $\theta(n^{2})$ time using $\theta(n^{2})$ memory.
+ This discover and many other discoveries led to the following questions:
	+ Can all problems be solved in Polynomial Time?
		+ Maybe we just haven't discovered all the good algorithms yet.
## P and NP
+ NP - set of problems where the solution can not be computed deterministically in polynomial time.
+ P - set of problems that can be solved deterministically in polynomial time.
## Nondeterministic algorithm
+ A nondeterministic algorithm is an algorithm that, even for the same input, can exhibit different behaviours on different runs
	+ The nondeterministic algorithms are often used to find an approximation to a solution, when the exact solution would be too costly to obtain using a deterministic one.
+ A deterministic algorithm is an algorithm that, given a particular input, will always produce the same output, with the underlying machine always passing through the same sequence of states.
# Polynomial Problems
## Non-deterministically Polynomial Problems
+ The **graph isomorphism** - problem of determine whether two graph can be drawn identically.
+ The **travelling salesman problem** - where we want to know if there is a route of same length that goes through all nodes in a certain network (graph)
## What is a decision problem?
+ A decision problem is a problem that can be posed as a yes-no question of the input values.
	+ Whether a given natural number is prime.
	+ Given two numbers $x$ and $y$, does $x$ evenly divide $y$?
## NP-completeness
+ NP - complete
	+ Is short for "*nondeterministic polynomial-time complete*"
+ A decision problem $D_{1}$ is said to be polynomially reducible to a decision problem $D_{2}$, if there exists a function $t$ that transforms instances of $D_{1}$ to instances of $D_{2}$ such that:
	+ $t$ maps all yes instances of $D_{1}$ to yes instances of $D_{2}$ and all no instances of $D_{1}$ to no instances of $D_{2}$.
	+ $t$ is computable by a polynomial time algorithm
+ A decision problem $D$ is said to be NP - complete if:
	+ It belongs to class $NP$.
	+ Every problem in $NP$ is polynomially reducible to $D$.
## What about optimisation problems?
+ NP - completeness has been studied in the framework of decision problems.
+ Most problems are not decision problems, but optimisation problems (where some value needs to be minimised or maximised).
+ In order to apply the theory of NP-completeness to optimisation problems, we must recast them as decision problems.
+ We provide an example of how an optimisation problem can be transformed into a decision problem.
## An example
+ Optimisation problem
	+ SHORTEST-PATH that finds a shortest path between two given vertices in an unweighted, undirected graph $G=(V,E)$.
+ Decision probme - A decision problem PATH related to the SHORTEWST-PATH problem above
