# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1 What is AI?
### 1.1.1 Definitions of AI
- **Thinking Humanly**
  - **Definition**: The effort to make computers think like humans.
  - **Key Quotes**:
    - “The exciting new effort to make computers think... machines with minds, in the full and literal sense.” (Haugeland, 1985)
    - “The automation of activities that we associate with human thinking, such as decision-making and problem-solving.” (Bellman, 1978)

- **Thinking Rationally**
  - **Definition**: The study of mental faculties through computational models.
  - **Key Quotes**:
    - “The study of the computations that make it possible to perceive, reason, and act.” (Winston, 1992)

- **Acting Humanly**
  - **Definition**: Creating machines that perform functions requiring intelligence when performed by people.
  - **Key Quotes**:
    - “The art of creating machines that perform functions that require intelligence when performed by people.” (Kurzweil, 1990)

- **Acting Rationally**
  - **Definition**: The study of intelligent behavior in artifacts.
  - **Key Quotes**:
    - “AI... is concerned with intelligent behavior in artifacts.” (Nilsson, 1998)

### 1.1.2 The Turing Test
- **Overview**: Proposed by Alan Turing (1950) as a measure of intelligence.
