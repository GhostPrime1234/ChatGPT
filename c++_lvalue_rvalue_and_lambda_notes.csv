What are iterators?,"Iterators provide a standard/unified way to access elements in containers, regardless of the underlying data structure."
What are the six building blocks of STL?,"Containers, iterators, algorithms, functors, adapters, allocators."
What are random access and sequential access?,"Random Access: Allows direct access to any element in a data structure, enabling fast retrieval (e.g., arrays, hash tables). Sequential Access: Requires accessing elements in a linear order, one by one, which can be slower (e.g., linked lists, sequential file reading)."
